## Packages

### `artifacts/api-server`
Express 5 REST API server running on port 8080. All routes mounted at `/api`.
Auth: JWT (access token in-memory + httpOnly refresh cookie via bcrypt).
File storage: Replit App Storage (GCS via sidecar). All uploads write to `$PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR/cadstone/uploads/...`; the `files.fileUrl` column keeps the `/uploads/<jobId>/<mediaType>/<filename>` shape and is mapped to a GCS object at read time. Do NOT write to local disk — the deployed filesystem is ephemeral. Always pass `contentType: uploadedFile.mimetype` to `writeUploadedBuffer`.

Routes:
- `GET /api/healthz` — health check
- `POST /api/auth/login|logout|refresh|forgot-password|reset-password`
- `POST /api/auth/register` — admin-only user creation
- `GET/PUT /api/users/me`, `GET /api/users`
- `GET/POST /api/jobs`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/jobs/:id`
- `GET/POST /api/jobs/:jobId/folders`
- `PUT/DELETE /api/folders/:id`, `POST /api/folders/:id/copy|move`
- `GET/POST /api/folders/:id/files`
- `GET /api/files/:id/download`, `DELETE /api/files/:id`
- `GET/POST /api/leads`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/leads/:id`
- `POST /api/leads/:id/contacts|attachments|convert-to-job`
- `GET /api/activity`
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats`
- `GET/POST /api/jobs/:jobId/daily-logs`, `GET /api/daily-logs/:id`
- `GET/POST /api/jobs/:jobId/schedule`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/schedule-items/:id`

### `artifacts/cadstone`
React + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui frontend. Runs on port assigned by `$PORT`.
Base path: `/`. Proxies `/api` to `localhost:8080`.
Router: **react-router-dom v6** (BrowserRouter + nested routes).

Key files:
- `src/App.tsx` — react-router-dom v6 BrowserRouter, protected routes, silent refresh on mount
- `src/lib/api.ts` — Axios named exports: `api` (auth interceptor) and `authApi` (raw). `bootstrapAuthSession` for session restore on app load.
- `src/store/auth.ts` — Zustand auth store (user, accessToken, setAuth, clearAuth)
- `src/components/layout/` — AppLayout, TopNav, Sidebar
- `src/components/FileBrowser.tsx` — shared file browser (folders + files) for Documents/Photos/Videos tabs
- `src/pages/` — All pages are fully implemented (no more stubs)

### Pages (all fully implemented)
- `/dashboard` — stat cards (active jobs, open leads, schedule items, my logs) + recent activity feed
- `/jobs` — jobs table with search, status filter, pagination + Create Job modal + delete
- `/jobs/:jobId/summary` — editable job form (all fields, work days toggles, save)
- `/jobs/:jobId/files/documents` — folder browser + file upload (documents)
- `/jobs/:jobId/files/photos` — folder browser + file upload (photos)
- `/jobs/:jobId/files/videos` — folder browser + file upload (videos)
- `/jobs/:jobId/schedule` — schedule items table + Add Item modal (color, dates, progress)
- `/jobs/:jobId/daily-logs` — daily log cards with search + New Log modal
- `/sales/leads` — leads table with search, status filter + New Lead modal + delete

Theme: Primary blue `#2563EB` (221 83% 53%), page bg `#F9FAFB`, white cards, `#E5E7EB` borders.

Design rules: shadcn/ui everywhere, all forms in Dialog modals, AlertDialog for deletes, 14px body text (`text-sm`), information-dense tables.

Frontend dependencies: axios, zustand, react-router-dom v6, sonner (toasts), lucide-react, shadcn/ui

### `lib/db`
Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL. 16 tables.

Key tables: users, jobs, folders, files, leads, lead_contacts, lead_attachments, schedule_items, schedule_assignees, daily_logs, daily_log_attachments, daily_log_tags, tags, activity_log

Seed: `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run seed` → 3 users, 5 jobs, 3 leads
Seed credentials: `cruz.martinez@cadstone.internal` / `Cadstone123!` (also maria.garcia, jake.thompson)

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run check-api-codegen` — re-run `@workspace/api-spec` codegen and fail if the generated React Query (`lib/api-client-react/src/generated/`) or Zod (`lib/api-zod/src/generated/`) clients drift from `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`
- `pnpm run validate` — `typecheck` + `check-api-codegen` (CI-style check; both are also registered as named validation commands)
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm test` — run the checked-in automated test suite
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run migrate` — apply checked-in SQL migrations
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run generate` — generate future Drizzle migrations
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run seed` — seed database with test data

## Auth & password management

This app does **not** have a self-serve "forgot password" / "reset password"
flow. Account creation is admin-only (`POST /api/auth/register` with the
`requireAdmin` middleware) and there is intentionally no transactional email
provider wired up.

For a team of ~5 employees, the cost of standing up an email service (domain
verification, DNS, deliverability, spam filtering, ongoing maintenance) is not
justified. Instead, the admin manages passwords directly:

- **New user:** admin calls `POST /api/auth/register` and shares the chosen
  password with the user out of band (e.g. in person or via a secure channel).
- **Forgotten / rotated password:** the user contacts the admin. The admin
  hands the new password value to the agent as a secret, and the agent
  rewrites `users.password_hash` for that account directly with bcrypt.

If the user count grows or the admin no longer wants to be in the loop, the
right next step is wiring a real transactional email integration (Resend or
SendGrid) and re-introducing `/forgot-password` + `/reset-password`. There is
a regression test in `artifacts/api-server/test/auth.test.ts` that asserts
those routes stay un-exposed until that decision is made deliberately.

## Deployment target — Reserved VM, not autoscale

The production deploy **must** run as a single Reserved VM (deployment type
`vm` in the Publishing pane). Do not use autoscale.

Two pieces of state live in the API server's process memory and silently break
when there is more than one instance:

1. **Rate limiter** (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/rate-limit.ts`) — counters
   live in an in-process `Map`, so each autoscale instance enforces its own
   limit. Effective limits become `instances × configured_max`.
2. **File-view JTI replay store** (`usedFileViewJtis` in
   `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/auth.ts`) — single-use download tokens are
   tracked in-process. Across multiple instances, a token used on instance A
   is still "fresh" on instance B, defeating the replay protection.

The deployment type cannot be set programmatically — it is configured in the
Publishing pane. If you ever switch to autoscale, both of the above must first
be moved to a shared store (Postgres or Redis).
